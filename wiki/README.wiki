#summary Installation and Usage Instructions for DAGGER.

== Contents == 
The package is available as a compressed *DAGGER* folder in [http://code.google.com/p/dagger-index/downloads/list Downloads] and as browsable files in [http://code.google.com/p/dagger-index/source/browse Source]. Once compiled, the package provides the following executables:

  # *DGRAIL*: The main executable which evaluates the performance of DAGGER, DFS or BFS on a given input graph and an _update file_ (a file that lists the changes to be applied to the graph).
  # *correctness*: It checks the correctness of DAGGER/DFS/BFS by comparing the result of each query on a given input graph and update file.
  # *Graph Generators*: Random graph generators.
      * *erGenerator*: Generates a random graph in Erdos-Renyi Model.
      * *baGenerator*: Generates a random graph in Barabasi-Albert Model.
  # *testGenerator*: Given an input graph, it generates a random sequence of valid update operations which can be used to evaluate reachability indices.
  # *Graph Extractors*:
      * *graphExtractorFromPairs*:
      * *graphExtractor*:
